The headings of sbet.txt are

    GpsTime,
    Y,X,Z,
    XVelocity,YVelocity,ZVelocity,
    Roll,Pitch,Azimuth,WanderAngle,
    XBodyAccel,YBodyAccel,ZBodyAccel,
    XBodyAngRate,YBodyAngRate,ZBodyAngRate

Now

    Y = UTM northing m
    X = UTM easting m
    Z = HAE m

    XVelocity = dY/dt - 0.135 (m/s) (not X)
    YVelocity = -dX/dt +/- 0.01 (note sign)
    ZVelocity = dZ/dt

    XBodyAccel = -d^2 X/dt^2 (m/s^2)
    YBodyAccel =  d^2 Y/dt^2 (m/s^2)
    ZBodyAccel = -d^2 Z/dt^2 (m/s^2)

Roll (about y), Pitch (about x), Azimuth (about -z) in deg

    XBodyAngRate = dRoll/dt (deg/s)
    YBodyAngRate = dPitch/dt (deg/s)
    ZBodyAngRate = dAzi/dt (deg/s)

Projection issues.  For C2_L2 dataset

    UTM Meridian convergence = -1.16177 deg
    UTM Scale = 1.0002338

Because scale is so close to unity, can't tell if velocity is in (UTM
m)/s or (true m)/s, etc.

Let Heading1 = atan2d(dX/dt, dY/dt)
    Heading2 = atan2d(-YVelocity, XVelocity)
    the difference between these is 0.117 deg (much less than meridican conv)

True Heading = Grid Heading + Meridian Convergence

mean(azi-heading) = -1.5 deg

It *might* be that azimuth is wrt true north (but can't really tell)
