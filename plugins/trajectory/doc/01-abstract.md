# [Trajectory estimation from multiple-return LIDAR pulses](README.md)

## Abstract

The paper describes how to recover the sensor trajectory for an aerial
LIDAR collect using the data for multiple-return LIDAR pulses.  This
work extends the work of Gatziolis and McGaughey (2019) by performing
a least squares fit for multiple pulses simulataneously with a spline
fit for the sensor trajectory.
